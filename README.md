# GoVid

A youtube clone made with `Gin` (Golang) and `Ruvy` (TypeScript).

## Run it locally

Assuming you have `Docker` in your machine, clone this project:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:RiadhAdrani/govid.git
```

`cd` into the cloned directory and run:

```bash
make install
```

which will install dependencies for the `frontend` and `backend`, then start development using:

```bash

```

## Hot reloading

Hot reloading is enabled for `backend` using `air` and `frontend` using `vite`.
